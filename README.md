# Stardew Valley Clone
Stardew Valley Clone is a project designed to replicate the main farming 
aspects of the stardew valley game. This project uses a MVC (model, view, 
controller) architecture and the pygame library to create game. The main 
functions of our game are to plant seeds, water them, and harvest them after 
the necessary number of days. The controls for the game are explained in more 
detail in the usage section. 

## Installation 
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install 
pygame and pytest. 

```bash
pip install -U pytest 
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

## Usage 
The game can be run by running the main.py file. 

The user can control their character using WASD keys to move up, left, down, 
and right respectively. The number keys can be used select a slot in the 
inventory, and once the user has an item selected (hoe, watering can, seed), the 
space bar can be used to use the item. Inventory slots can also be selected
by clicking on the desired item. Different plants have different numbers 
of days they take to grow and must be watered every day to grow. The user can 
sleep by entering the house and walking to the bed and can harvest plants by 
pressing H.

## Credits
The people that worked on this project were Alex George, Amanda Chang, and
